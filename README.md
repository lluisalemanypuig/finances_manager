# Finances Manager

Manage your domestic monthly expenses via the command line.

## Configuration

Before using the program, first create a file called `project_configuration.json` with the following contents
	
	{
		"base_path" : "BASE_PATH",
		"income_name": "INCOME_NAME"
	}

where

	- `BASE_PATH` is the path to the directory that will contain all your data.
	- `INCOME_NAME` is the translation of the English word "income" into your language.
